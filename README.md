## Features

- **Language agnostic:** just like `mkdocs`, `mkdocstrings` is written in Python but is language-agnostic.
  It means you can use it for any language, as long as you implement a
  [`handler`](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocstrings/reference/handlers/__init__/) for it.
  Currently, we only have a [Python handler](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocstrings/reference/handlers/python/).
  Maybe you'd like to contribute another one :wink:?
- **Multiple themes support:** each handler can offer multiple themes. Currently, we only offer the
  :star: [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) :star: for the Python handler.
- **Cross-references to other objects:** `mkdocstrings` makes it possible to reference other headings from your
  Markdown files with the classic Markdown syntax: `[identifier][]` or `[title][identifier]`. This feature is language
  agnostic as well: you can cross-reference any heading that appear in your Markdown pages.
  If the handler for a particular language renders headings for documented objects, you'll be able to reference them!
- **Inline injection in Markdown:** instead of generating Markdown files, `mkdocstrings` allows you to inject
  documentation anywhere in your Markdown contents. The syntax is simple: `::: identifier` followed by a 4-spaces
  indented YAML block. The identifier and YAML configuration will be passed to the appropriate handler
  to collect and render documentation.
- **Global and local configuration:** each handler can be configured globally in `mkdocs.yml`, and locally for each
  "autodoc" instruction.
- **Watch source code directories:** you can tell `mkdocstrings` to add directories to be watched by `mkdocs` when
  serving the documentation, for auto-reload.
- **Sane defaults:** you should be able to just drop the plugin in your configuration and enjoy your auto-generated docs.

### Python handler features

- **Data collection from source code**: collection of the object-tree and the docstrings is done by
  [`pytkdocs`](https://github.com/pawamoy/pytkdocs). The following features are possible thanks to it:
    - **Support for type annotations:** `pytkdocs` collects your type annotations and `mkdocstrings` uses them
      to display parameters types or return types.
    - **Recursive documentation of Python objects:** just use the module dotted-path as identifier, and you get the full
      module docs. You don't need to inject documentation for each class, function, etc.
    - **Support for documented attribute:** attributes (variables) followed by a docstring (triple-quoted string) will
      be recognized by `pytkdocs` in modules, classes and even in `__init__` methods.
    - **Support for objects properties:** `pytkdocs` detects if a method is a `staticmethod`, a `classmethod`, etc.,
      it also detects if a property is read-only or writable, and more! These properties will be displayed
      next to the object signature by `mkdocstrings`.
    - **Google-style sections support in docstrings:** `pytkdocs` understands `Arguments:`, `Raises:`
      and `Returns:` sections, and returns structured data for `mkdocstrings` to render them.
    - **Admonition support in docstrings:** blocks like `Note: ` or `Warning: ` will be transformed
      to their [admonition](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/) equivalent.
      *We do not support nested admonitions in docstrings!*
- **Every object has a TOC entry:** we render a heading for each object, meaning `mkdocs` picks them into the Table
  of Contents, which is nicely display by the Material theme. Thanks to `mkdocstrings` cross-reference ability,
  you can even reference other objects within your docstrings, with the classic Markdown syntax:
  `[this object][package.module.object]` or directly with `[package.module.object][]`
- **Source code display:** `mkdocstrings` can add a collapsible div containing the highlighted source code
  of the Python object.

To get an example of what is possible, check `mkdocstrings`'
own [documentation](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocstrings), auto-generated from sources by itself of course,
and the following GIF:

## Roadmap

- [x] **December-January 2020:** Proof of Concept.
- [x] **January-March 2020:** Refactor.
- [x] **March-April 2020:** Test suite for [`pytkdocs`](https://github.com/pawamoy/pytkdocs). Bug fixes, enhancements.
- [ ] **May-June 2020:** Test suite for `mkdocstrings` itself. **Better documentation.** Maybe a second handler, just for the fun.

## Requirements

`mkdocstrings` requires Python 3.6 or above.

<details>
<summary>To install Python 3.6, I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><code>pyenv</code></a>.</summary>

```bash
# install pyenv
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ~/.pyenv

# setup pyenv (you should also put these three lines in .bashrc or similar)
export PATH="${HOME}/.pyenv/bin:${PATH}"
export PYENV_ROOT="${HOME}/.pyenv"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# install Python 3.6
pyenv install 3.6.8

# make it available globally
pyenv global system 3.6.8
```
</details>

This project currently only works with the Material theme of MkDocs. Therefore, it is required that you have it installed.

```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

## Installation

With `pip`:
```bash
python3.6 -m pip install mkdocstrings
```

## Usage

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
theme:
  name: "material"

plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocstrings:
      default_handler: python
      handlers:
        python:
          rendering:
            show_source: true
      watch:
        - src/my_library
```

In one of your markdown files:

```yaml
# Reference

::: my_library.my_module.my_class
    rendering:
      show_source: false


::: org.jpackage.BestOfTheBestFactoryInterface
    handler: java  # we don't have a java handler yet, it's just an example
```

In documentation strings (written in Markdown), you can reference objects from other places:

```python
def some_function():
    """
    This is my function.

    It references [another function][package.submodule.function].
    It also references another object directly: [package.submodule.SuperClass][].
    """
    pass
```

Add some style in `docs/custom.css`:

```css
div.doc-contents:not(.first) {
  padding-left: 25px;
  border-left: 4px solid rgba(230, 230, 230);
  margin-bottom: 80px;
}
```

And add it to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
extra_css:
  - custom.css
```
