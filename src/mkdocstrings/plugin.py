"""
This module contains the `mkdocs` plugin.

The plugin instantiates a Markdown extension ([`MkdocstringsExtension`][mkdocstrings.extension.MkdocstringsExtension]),
and adds it to the list of Markdown extensions used by `mkdocs`
during the [`on_config` event hook](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/#on_config).

After each page is processed by the Markdown converter, this plugin stores absolute URLs of every HTML anchors
it finds to later be able to fix unresolved references.
It stores them during the [`on_page_contents` event hook](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/#on_page_contents).

Just before writing the final HTML to the disc, during the
[`on_post_page` event hook](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/#on_post_page),
this plugin searches for references of the form `[identifier][]` or `[title][identifier]` that were not resolved,
and fixes them using the previously stored identifier-URL mapping.

Once the documentation is built, the [`on_post_build` event hook](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/#on_post_build)
is triggered and calls the [`handlers.teardown()` method][mkdocstrings.handlers.teardown]. This method is used
to teardown the [handlers][mkdocstrings.handlers] that were instantiated during documentation buildup.

Finally, when serving the documentation, it can add directories to watch
during the [`on_serve` event hook](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/#on_serve).
